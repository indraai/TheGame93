MUD Chat

You may use this code as you wish as long as if you give me credit where
credit is due.

It is now the start of summer 1996 and this code was worked on in the end
of the summer of 1995.  So much time has pasted so my memory is a little
foggy.  However, this code does work perfectly for MERC muds and the code
could be easily incorporated into other muds.

My email address will change soon.  My current one is cbusch@d.umn.edu, I
dont know what will be my new email address.

If you have any questions on how to install this into your mud, please
mail me.

The 'chat' directory should be placed beneath the MERC src directory.


The Chat engine code is in C++ and many muds are written in C, and this is
the case with MERC.  However, with the GNU compilers that I have used, you
can link the two types of .o files together.  You just need a .h file to
explain to C what entry points to use to access C++ functions.  Please see
the MERC example makefile that I have included here.

cbusch_add_to* files explain how to modify the merc source files.  The
chat.data file needs to be accessable from the 'area' directory.  To do so
just make a soft link ("ln" command) to chat.data.

One last thing.  If you use this code for you mud can you please tell me
about it! Also if you could set up a player on it for me.  I would like to
see it. 

Good luck!
