During the summer of '95 I added a MERC mud interface into this  program.
In this way NPC's are able to hold better conversations.

To install this system into a MERC mud, you will need to make a soft link
to chat.data.  I encourage people to attempt to port this code to other
MUDs. 


Please see the chat.doc file.

The following files are included with this distribution.
