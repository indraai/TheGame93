# TheGame93

TheGame93 came about after spending four years research the Hacker culture from the inside out, and then building a system to travel that research.

Through the environment you can walk through various Hacker operations and events that have transpired over the years to educate yourself, and gain information that can be used to inform others.

This portion of the research is the MUD (Multi User Dungeon) realms that the various hacker groups utilize while keeping the rest of the world focused on IRC activities.
