fountain~
This is the most beautiful fountain you have ever set your eyes upon!  It has a marble bottom, which is clean enough to eat off from.  In the center of the fountain, you see some stone FIGURES.  They have their mouths open.  As you look closely you can see that there is water streaming out from the mouths. What a neat idea!
