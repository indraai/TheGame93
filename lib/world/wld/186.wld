A Long East-West Passage~
   This is a long, narrow passage leading east and west.  The walls are
damp and covered with mildew and fungus.  There is a very unhealthy air
about this place and you're beginning to want out of here... soon.

The Red Room~
   It takes you a moment to realize that the red glow here is coming
from a round portal on the floor.  It looks almost as if someone had
painted a picture of a dirt running through a field on the floor of
this room.  Oddly enough, it is so realistic you can feel the wind in
the field coming out of the picture.

here... no telling what you may run into here.

from the sounds you hear all around you, it seems as if something has
