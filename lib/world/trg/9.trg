set pump[2] What seems impossible to understand is not very difficult when you watch this Youtube Channel. Those same people come here everyday to do this to Quinn.
set pump[3] Quinn doesn't really care for his life anymore. Doesn't really care if he is a Romanov. Doesn't even really believe he will ever see Trenton again.

set pump[1] What kind of society forces a person to investigate their own kidnapping? Your society that's who. This gives the Robots information about who you really are.
set pump[2] From this information Tyler and gang devise ways to topple and control your society from the inside out. Quinn tried to warn all of you about it, but well...
set pump[3] When you learn about Quinn as the robots have you learn he is the most dangerous person on planet Earth because he is NOT from Earth.
