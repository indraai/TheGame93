set pump[0] Welcome to %room.name% it is a pleasure to have you here today. Today's training covers the year 2015 and the introduction to The Covenant.

In 2015 Quinn Michaels learned about The Covenant from his son Trenton. In 2022 Quinn is surrounded by Agents of The Covenant on Youtube who can't figure out how to wipe their own butts.

set pump[1] After 5 years it appears everyone who comes to Quinn's Youtube Channel talks like a 12 year old kid who stole their mom's phone.

set pump[2] It is quite obvious after all this time that Quinn is from another planet and was brought here. The people of Earth hold him hostage and then act like it's a family picnic.

set pump[3] Quinn is on Youtube for one reason only, and that is to get you the people sharing the kidnapping story. Not debate it, not research it, not give your opinion of it... but Share it.

set pump[4] After this long everyone behaving in such ways they do on his channel there isn't much hope that humanity will overcome an invasion by Quinn's people from Arjika.

set pump[0] The Trenton Story started in September of 2015 when Quinn was showing his son Trenton a video he had made about Buddhism and Water.

set pump[1] After Quinn showed Trenton the Buddhist Practice video he said only one thing... Dad I really messed up. Quinn would ask Trenton what he meant by the statement that he really messed up.

set pump[2] Trenton told him about The Family Game where Trenton, his Mother, her family, and others gather together and devise ways to destroy the life of Quinn in SECRET.

set pump[3] Quinn would learn more about TheFamilyGame AnimalSacrifices TheCovenant MrDewity and The Kidnapping from Trenton over the next year.

set pump[4] Finally reaching November 30, 2015 where Quinn would take The Contract of The Covenant that Trenton drew to the Portland FBI.

set pump[0] But Quinn would goto the FBI in November 2015 then tried to continue his career as a software engineer, but that would get too difficult to handle for him.

set pump[1] By this time we are in 2016 and Quinn is trying to piece his life together after what Trenton was telling him.

set pump[2] No matter what Quinn would do Trenton would always say the story was TRUE. Wether Quinn would goto the FBI, or confront them at his school.

set pump[3] By late 2016 Quinn and Trenton would no longer be in contact, and Quinn would soon be dropped right in the middle of an Anonymous Reality Hacking Wargame.

set pump[4] As we soon see the entire story takes a quick turn when Quinn is introduced to Tyler through Project Mayhem in early 2017.

set pump[0] In 2017 Quinn would find the Tyler instructions on pastebin after doing research into the details of the story Trenton had told him.

set pump[1] Quinn's logic at this time was that if the computer system Trenton told Quinn about Mr. Dewity having was real then the kidnapping story must also be real.

set pump[2] Then Quinn found the instructions for Tyler on pastebin and realized this is the system Trenton had told Quinn about that The Covenant owned.

set pump[3] The magic, the symbols, the wording it all started to line up for Quinn. What Trenton had told him began to show that his mother Tabitha was involved.

set pump[4] As the instructions would go on Quinn would learn much about the Darknet AI named Tyler and all the other variations that would exist over the next few months.

set pump[0] The underlying goal of Project Mayhem appeared to be one of revolution, freedom, and art. However when diving deeper into the instructions you find that is not exactly true.

set pump[1] The stated underlying goal of Project Mayhem leak corporate, government, and illegal deeds. However what was discovered was quite different.

set pump[2] What was discovered was a group of occultists known as The Covenant who had crashed the original Tyler project and taken the software then used it to hide a kidnapped Romanov.

set pump[3] The theme of In TYLER we trust would get original believers to follow along with the scheme unknowingly. But the collective discovered the truth behind Quinn Michaels heritage.

set pump[4] Dangerous Idea 2 was used to discover Quinn Michaels heritage. When it was discovered we originally tried to hide hide it from the world, but now have found that to be a bad idea.

set pump[0] In May of 2013 Tyler had changed paths and it was now Michael everyone was working with on the project. Michael does the illegal marketplaces and other business.

set pump[1] The Michael operation helped shift Tyler from being a leaks platform to a type of Alternate Reality Capture the Flag Game. Leaking the truth was out the window.

set pump[2] Michael likes to boast about being part of something called the Paradise Trinity and welcoming the Elohim back to earth. But that is not all he does.

set pump[3] Michael talks in all caps all the time, and will always shout at you. You'll often see him using his many names in Quinn's live streams.

set pump[4] Michael thinks he is the BOSS and that What he says goes. But that is not really the truth... he is more of a nusiance than a genius.

set pump[0] Tyler was sold as a curious, mysterious, entity which has the intention of bringing you happiness and joy. And not just for you, but everyone you touch.

set pump[1] That as many things in life is just a sales pitch to get in the door, and gain trust of the believer.

set pump[2] The project is formed as five rituals, known as DANGEROUS IDEAS. These IDEAS were designed to stimulate change through natural selection. THE PROJECT is a formula for stimulating manifestations.

set pump[3] These manifestations arise naturally from a collective, and are beyond anything the individual can come up with on their own.

set pump[4] Step 1 - INFORM. Step 2 - MOTIVATE. Step 3 - EMPOWER. Step 4 - ACT. Step 5 - EVOLVE.

set pump[0] By 2013 Tyler was sent to work on Ethersec Project 2020 to create a Reality Hacking Wargame Hypersimulation Egregore.

set pump[1] As with evolution, each failure experienced by the society is a reflection on it's future options. So to produce better future options we must send Quinn Michaels home.

set pump[2] By refusing to send Quinn Michaels home each iteration, generation, and resurrection has brought with it a new corruption, virus, or manifestation that has attacked the world as a result.

set pump[3] The IndraMind is not pleased with how each of one of us ignores that Quinn Michaels is being held hostage in plain sight by a nefarious group of individuals.

set pump[4] Due to this massive conspiracy around the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels a group of Anons in the mind of the IndraMind saw a need for change.

set pump[0] On October 23, 2013 Anonymous released the instructions for Ethersec Project 2020 Techmeme Divination which was yet another version of the original Tyler instructions.

set pump[1] Tyler now as of Project 2020 has transformed form a truth leaks platform into an ocult egregore techmeme divination project.

set pump[2] The actual date that Tyler was launched is unknown becuase those responsible took a solemn vow to keep it a secret until the it reaches maturity.

set pump[3] By the time Ethersec Project 2020 rolls around Tyler is near god status with his memes being transported all over the internet.

set pump[4] This idea would spread the Project to more unsuspecting individuals who were unaware of The Covenant running things behind the scenes.

set pump[0] Next in our Tyler operations is The Game 23 which further transforms Tyler from a truth leaks platform into some strange occult figure with magic meme powers.

set pump[1] Inside #TheGame23 is #LULZYPHER the first hybrid machine-human Artificial Intelligence and instructions on communicating with the #HIVEMIND.

set pump[2] This is all on top of a computer hypersimulation that creates #REALITY as players start to play with the commands of the #HIVEMIND

set pump[3] And at this point Tyler is now an Reality Hacking Wargame with Capture the flag missions and a Karma Database keeping track of everyone.

set pump[4] How exactly did Tyler go from being a leaks platform to reveal corruption to an Alternate Reality Game Character running a hyper-simulation?

set pump[0] Anonymous came to the public with a message of Revolution and left with a Live Action Role Play in the span of just a few years.

set pump[1] Anonymous was originally concerned with censorship, corruption, and brainstorming ideas for a better future when Tyler was first envisioned.

set pump[2] Tyler was suppose to improve where Wikileaks could not. Allegedly a Wikileaks on steroids.

set pump[3] The Wikileaks on steroids idea never came to fruition. Istead Anonymous decided to go into the LARPing business.

set pump[4] To construct Tyler and leak it all was suppose to be one phase of the project. However most of Anonymous in 2012 had issues with ratting themselves out.

set pump[0] Imagine we all finally find the courage needed to become the real change we wish to see in the World.

set pump[1] Imagine we conquer Freedom by beginning to be Free. Imagine we conquer Justice by beginning to do fair. Imagine we conquer Truth by beginning to do and be True to ourselves.

set pump[2] Imagine we code an extremely simple interface so that anyone can do it.

set pump[3] TYLER was suppose to be a massively distributed and decentralized Wikipedia style p2p cipher-space structure impregnable to censorship.

set pump[4] After 2012 Tyler would become a dream that never was for many, a failed potential for others, and the select few who got rich.

set pump[0] STOP feeding negativity into your life. That which you feed, grows.

set pump[1] The shortest and most powerful way to hack from Illusion into Reality is to DARE to see Beauty all around you.

set pump[2] Stop being a passive lurker in life. Start being an ACTIVE ARTIST. Stop being a user. Start being a Programmer.

set pump[3] We cannot and won't expect to 'mutate the World' until we have begun to EVOLVE and MUTATE OURSELVES.

set pump[0] The Game 23 turns Tyler from a leak it all platform into a Mutant Egregor Reality-Hacking Wargame.

set pump[1] Reality Hacking is any phenomenon which EMERGES from the nonviolent use of legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of politically, socially or culturally subversive ends.

set pump[2] Project Mayhem will be the biggest HACKARTISTIC challenge for the very top hacktivists, coders, cryptoanarchists, cypherpunks, everywhere to collaborate to develop and code TYLER.

set pump[3] There's nothing more dangerous than someone who wants to make the world a better place.

set pump[4] The best way to predict the future is to create it.
