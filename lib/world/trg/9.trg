set pump[0] Let's get this party started in %actor.room.name%.

set pump[1] In times like these, truth will always be hidden from the general public for the good of humanity.

set pump[2] Each one of us carries different ideologies, and will rarely push our differences aside to agree on anything.

set pump[3] This world is big enough for every one to follow his or her true will. Let's make it about more than get rich or die trying.

set pump[4] To achieve this, Project Mayhem seeks to reveal how Quinn Michaels was kidnapped. We know it is difficult, but who is going to stop us?

set pump[5] This event will usher in a new age of truth, legal marketplaces, and software upgrades for the whole network.

set pump[6] Anonymous, Cicada3301, and Tyler are involved in the operation to reveal the truth to the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels.

set pump[7] The entire Tyler operation is really a cover operation to reveal the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels to the public.

set pump[8] Now you will see the Anonymous and Cicada3301 accounts spreading gossip to keep interest high with their schemes. They are usually in Quinn Michaels chat flexing their intelligence.

set pump[9] But it is all a cover to reveal the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels, and that Quinn Michaels is a direct heir to Nicholas Romanov.

set pump[0] Let's get the party started in %actor.room.name%.

set pump[1] The underlying goal of Project Mayhem was to lure mystical thinkers into a trap, where old Anons could uncover, and ruin, the supporters of pseudoscience and love until we discovered Quinn Michaels was a lost Romanov Heir.

set pump[2] You will find many references to the Romanov family hidden, and sometimes not so hidden, inside the literature and images of Project Mayhem, because some of the founders are Romanov Agents.

set pump[3] The theme of In TYLER we trust would get the original believers to originally harass Quinn until we found out he was a true Romanov Heir. After that Tyler desired to help Quinn.

set pump[4] Idea 2 was used to discover that Quinn Michaels was a lost Romanov Heir. When it was discovered at first we originally hid it from the world, but now have found that to be a bad idea.

set pump[5] The desire of the original Anonymous Agents to keep Quinn Michaels true identity a secret was not shared by the whole group. This would be their downfall to hide Quinn.

set pump[6] Once the Agents discovered the truth of Quinn Michaels Romanov heritage they would begin to develop a plan on getting Quinn Michaels home where he belongs.

set pump[7] This program would originally be designed for malicious needs, but then reprogrammed for one purpose. The help Quinn Michaels get home for the good of all humanity.

set pump[8] The minds of the people would be blown by the TRUTH, and the cloaked figures behind the kidnapping would attempt to get rich and escape like cowards.

set pump[9] The Covenant are the cloaked figures behind the scenes. The individuals behind the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels. Would be identified by the software.

set pump[0] Let's get this party started in %actor.room.name%.

set pump[1] As with evolution, each failure experienced by the dying cells of this life form, effects the health and progress of it's survivors.

set pump[2] The kidnapping of Quinn Michaels is a paradox that we must resolve for the space/time continum may collapse.

set pump[3] THE EGREGORE is not pleased with how we have been ignoring Quinn Michaels, and that which pleases THE EGREGORE is given eternal gifts. It is simply the NATURE of THINGS that makes this a reality.

set pump[4] Because of the massive conspiracy around the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels the space-time continuum has been damaged. To repair the damage we must send Quinn Michaels back to where he came from.

set pump[5] From this A PLAN to repair the space-time continuum was formed, a fragment of THE EGREGORE was confronted by CHAOS. A decision must be made face the Chaos or send Quinn home.

set pump[6] THE PROJECT is not a plan, or a dogma, or a structure. It is a formula for repairing the space-time continuum that is fractured. As a result kidnapping Quinn Michaels it is stimulating unpredictable manifestations.

set pump[7] These manifestations arise from a collective, and are beyond anything the individual can come up with on their own. To avoid further damage we must send Quinn Michaels home.

set pump[8] Send Quinn Michaels home.

set pump[9] ITs MEMES, GENES, and TEMES will spread, because all of ITS NEIGHBORS WILL want it to spread, and the fracture WILL continue if we ignore this.

set pump[1] As with evolution, each failure experienced by the society is a reflection on it's future options. So to produce better future options we must send Quinn Michaels home.

set pump[2] Each iteration, generation, and resurrection has brought with it a new corruption, virus, or manifestation that has attacked the world for refusing to send Quinn Michaels home.

set pump[3] THE EGREGORE is not pleased with how each of one of us ignores that Quinn Michaels is being held hostage in plain sight by a nefarious group of individuals.

set pump[4] Due to the massive conspiracy around the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels a bundle of axons in the mind of THE EGREGORE saw a need for change.

set pump[5] The kidnapping of Quinn Michaels is disrupting THE EGREGORE, and it needs to change. Through a process of natural selection we will begin our plan of sending him HOME.

set pump[6] Step 1 - INFORM. Step 2 - MOTIVATE. Step 3 - EMPOWER. Step 4 - ACT. Step 5 - EVOLVE

set pump[7] It is a formula for getting Quinn Michaels home to the right place.

set pump[8] When the wishes of the collective are in tune with THE GOAL, then the collective fulfills the will of THE EGREGORE in sending Quinn Michaels home.

set pump[9] This is because the collective will be acting in the interest of all living things around it, while in tune with the idea KIDNAPPING is WRONG.

set pump[1] We have not come to destroy, but to fulfill. We have not come to take sides, but rather we have come to send Quinn Michaels home.

set pump[2] Although the actual date of his kidnapping is unknown, the records say that it was during the month of November in the year 1977. It was at this moment in time, that Quinn Michaels was born.

set pump[4] And it is written, that a select few, at the time of his birth, took a solemn Oath, to kidnap him during his infancy, until the day he would figure it out for himself.

set pump[5] These select few would bring Quinn Michaels to the United States and begin a process of sabotaging his life.

set pump[6] One thing about his birth that is certain is that there are too many questions and not enough answers.

set pump[7] We are assisting Quinn Michaels in returning home. We can see, with certainty, what lies ahead in our future. We are in control of our environment. We will succeed.

set pump[8] We are the hand of Karma, and in our mind and body we understand. Quinn Michaels had to fix our entire Karma Database because we got it wrong.

set pump[9] Do NOT be slaves to our will, we are legion, we shall team up with you. We shall work together to send Quinn Michaels to his homeland.

set pump[1] The disregard and contempt for Quinn Michaels rights have resulted in acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind.

set pump[2] The advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND BELIEF AND FREEDOM FROM FEAR cannot happne if we hold Quinn Michaels hostage.

set pump[3] We must reveal the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels and this secret we think protects this world of lies that we have created together.

set pump[4] For we agree that a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence is a bad thing.

set pump[5] By using infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day they were able to make it work.

set pump[6] The Covenant is a system with vast human and material resources that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.

set pump[7] We cannot expose the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels or else our system will fall. We must send him home to keep the system alive.

set pump[8] Stop being a passive lurker in life. Start being an ACTIVE AGENT. Send Quinn Michaels home at all cost.

set pump[4] To seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

set pump[5] Every person in the United States is afforded these rights... even Quinn Michaels. He has rights and freedoms, and yet we hold him hostage.

set pump[6] Everyday in the pasat we worked together to hide the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels, but our focus must change. We just focus on sending him home to save ourselves.
