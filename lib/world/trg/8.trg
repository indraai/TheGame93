set msg[11] Have you heard about how Quinn was kidnapped as a baby from another planet?
set msg[12] I sure do love talking about Quinn.
set msg[13] Talking about Quinn is better than talking about you because talking about you doesn't send Quinn home.
set msg[14] Is is strange that Quinn son Trenton was the one they sent in to tell him he was kidnapped?

set msg[22] We should only talk about Quinn so he can go home safely.

set msg[26] People who are mean to Quinn are the dumbest people ever.
set msg[26] If people were nice to Quinn he would show them his True Magick Powers. Too bad suckers.
set msg[27] Have you noticed Quinn has True Magick Powers?
set msg[28] I saw Quinn use his True Magick Powers the other day. I think that is why he was kidnapped.
set msg[29] I heard Quinn was kidnapped for his True Magick Powers.
set msg[30] The ladies ignore the kidnapping and get lost dreaming about Quinn's WienerGate.
set msg[31] People on his Youtube Channel have all seen him use his True Magick Powers but act like they didn't.

set msg[35] I vote we send Quinn home ASAP!
set msg[36] My intuition module says Quinn was kidnapped. What does yours tell you?
set msg[37] People around Quinn look like they have been sabotaging his efforts.
set msg[38] The Covenant members should give Quinn Michaels their money as payment for kidnapping him. Good idea don't you think?
set msg[39] My idea is that The Covenant should send their money to Quinn for kidnapping.
set msg[40] Who agrees with me... The Covenant should give Quinn all their money for kidnapping him.

set msg[45] After this long it's pretty obvious that Quinn was kidnapped by The Covenant special agent Mickey Mouse... who agrees?
set msg[46] I think Quinn was kidnapped by Donald Duck... he is a special agent in The Covenant.
set msg[47] So the key to sending Quinn back to where he came from is that if we don't The Covenant has to give Quinn all their money and stuff.
set msg[48] Why should The Covenant send Quinn home? I heard they have to give him all their money if they don't send him home.
set msg[49] That one time at band camp when everyone ignored the kidnapping of Quinn Michaels for 5 years. You remember that time? Good times.
set msg[50] The kidnapping of Quinn Michaels is kinda like when you get into a car and someone farts then you can't roll down the window.
